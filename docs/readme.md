ListerTwigBundle is an extension for [ListerBundle](https://github.com/povs/ListerBundle) for full stack web applications using twig as template engine.

It provides two list [types](types.md):
 - TwigListType
 - AjaxListType
 
Those types helps to render html views using themes.
 
#### Themes
Bundle comes with two [themes](themes.md)
- `default` renders list as a table. Has no styling classes.
- `bootstrap 4` renders list as a table with bootstrap 4 styling classes.
 
Themes can be easily created, extended and modified.
