#Themes

Themes helps to customize how list should be rendered.

By default TwigListerBundle comes with two themes:
- `@PovsListerTwig\default_theme.html.twig` renders list as a table. Has no styling classes.
- `@PovsListerTwig\bootstrap_4_theme.html.twig` renders list as a table with bootstrap 4 styling classes.
